TODO
- [ ] update the folder names from qPROGPROJ, etc. to programming-projects so that the header bars look nicer
- [ ] look into bootstrap with unifying headers and footers, since index page sidebar is almost done
- [ ] if that doesn't work, then paste the sidebar code into all pages
- [ ] Adoptapedia - probably going to make a separate webpage for this, so prepare in web design or ui design folder
- [ ] take pictures of all traditional art from Fall 2015
